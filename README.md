# Project-BeijingFoodMap
This is a food map of Beijing collaboratively created by DQ and his shareholders, and it will be updated irregularly.
The map can be zoomed in by dragging a selection box and zoomed out by double-clicking. Clicking above the map boundary will reveal a specific toolbar. For an optimal interactive experience, using a computer is recommended.

The search box on the left can be used to search for signature dishes, such as "dumplings" or "meat pies." The options menu allows you to select different types of food.

Due to the current limited amount of data, everyone is welcome to act as project shareholders and actively submit contributions to DQ. Submissions should include the shop name; if possible, also include recommended dishes; considering a potential future rating system update, a score out of 10 can be added.

If you cannot directly contact DQ, you can invest by sending the above information to deulofeu@foxmail.com.
